# k-pop.io

A gotcha game for k-pop. To be any good at it, you either need to be rich or know your stuff :)

--- TECH STACK ---

Typescript, React, Nodejs, PostgreSQL, Graphql, TypeORM.

--- GETTING STARTED --

client
npm install
npm start
server
npm install

--- HOW TO CONTRIBUTE ---

The Jira board is for internal use only, meaning once you start making contributions on github I will add you to it and you officially gain "employee" status, and will start making money when the project does.
You do not need to be a developer to help us with the project. We are looking for project managers, graphic designers, and anyone who can make the product better.
